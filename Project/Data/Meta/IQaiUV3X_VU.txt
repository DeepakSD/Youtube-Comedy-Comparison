The theme tune for Guile, specifically his CP System II version, is the subject of a mashup internet phenomenon named "Guile's Theme Goes With Everything", starting in April 2010, which demonstrated the flexibility of the piece by showing how regardless of the video content, it synchronises with the music. This quickly grew to some 5500 videos.

Guile made his first appearance in Street Fighter II (1991) as one of the eight selectable characters featured in the first release of the game. A JTAC in the United States Air Force Tactical Air Control Party, he leaves his country and family to enter the World Warrior tournament to avenge the death of his friend Charlie, who was killed by M. Bison, the tournament's sponsor, sometime before the events of the game. In his ending, he defeats Bison, but is dissuaded from killing him by his wife and their daughter.
Guile's war buddy Charlie would appear in the later prequel series Street Fighter Alpha, although Guile himself did not appear in this sub-series until the console versions of Street Fighter Alpha 3 (1998). Originally CAPCOM wanted to make Guile an Army Ranger, but thought it wasn't hardcore enough and stumbled across the JTAC career-field, they originally made Guile a hidden character in the initial PlayStation version of the game, though subsequent versions made him part of the initial roster. In his storyline in the game, Guile is an Air Force JTAC ordered to track down Charlie, who has gone missing. Guile eventually fights Charlie, as well as Bison as his final opponent. In his ending, Guile infiltrates Bison's base with Charlie and sets explosives on the Psycho Drive, only for them to be caught in the act by Bison. Charlie holds off Bison while Guile escapes and the base explodes with Charlie still in it, resulting in his death.
Guile also appears as a playable character in Street Fighter EX (1997) and its two sequels, Street Fighter EX2 (1998) and Street Fighter EX3 (2000). The storyline of the EX series takes place at the same time as Street Fighter II. In addition to tracking down Shadaloo to avenge Charlie, Guile is also hunted by a mercenary named Doctrine Dark (another playable character in this sub-series), who is actually a former subordinate named Holger. His relationship with Ken as brothers-in-law (with their respective wives being sisters) is mentioned for the first time in the games in Ken's ending in the Japanese version of the original EX2.
Guile is one of the returning characters who appears in Street Fighter IV. He seeks authorization to conduct a rescue mission for his missing comrade Charlie, but his request is denied by his superiors.

MS Costa Concordia (Italian pronunciation: [ˈkɔsta konˈkɔrdja]) is a Concordia-class cruise ship operated by Costa Crociere (a subsidiary of Carnival Corporation) and built by the Fincantieri's Sestri Ponente yards in Italy. The name Concordia was intended to express the wish for "continuing harmony, unity, and peace between European nations."[3]
Costa Concordia was the first of the Concordia class cruise ships, followed by sister ships Costa Serena, Costa Pacifica, Costa Favolosa and Costa Fascinosa, and Carnival Splendor built for Carnival Cruise Lines. When the 114,137 GT Costa Concordia and her sisters entered service, they were among the largest ships built in Italy until the construction of the 130,000 GT Dream class cruise ships.
On 13 January 2012 at about 9:45 pm, in calm seas and overcast weather, under command of Captain Francesco Schettino, Costa Concordia struck a rock in the Tyrrhenian Sea just off the eastern shore of Isola del Giglio, off the western coast of Italy about 100 km (62 mi) northwest of Rome.[4][5] This tore a 50 m (160 ft) gash on the port (left) side of her hull, which almost immediately flooded parts of the engine room and caused loss of power to her propulsion and electrical systems. With water flooding in and listing, the ship drifted back to Giglio Island, where she grounded just 500 m (1,600 ft) north of the village of Giglio Porto, lying on her starboard (right) side in shallow water with most of her starboard side under water.[6][7] Despite the gradual sinking of the ship, its complete loss of power, and its proximity to shore in calm seas, an order to abandon ship was not issued until over an hour after the initial impact. Although international maritime law requires all passengers to be evacuated within 30 minutes of an order to abandon ship, the evacuation of the Costa Concordia took over six hours and not all passengers were evacuated. Of the 3,229 passengers and 1,023 crew known to have been aboard, two are missing and 32 are confirmed dead,[8] including a five-year-old girl whose body was found along with seven others by divers on February 23, over a month following the incident.</media:description><media:keywords/><media:license type='text/html' href='http://www.youtube.com/t/terms'>youtube</media:license><media:player url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQaiUV3X_VU&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IQaiUV3X_VU/default.jpg' height='90' width='120' time='00:00:31' yt:name='default'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IQaiUV3X_VU/mqdefault.jpg' height='180' width='320' yt:name='mqdefault'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IQaiUV3X_VU/hqdefault.jpg' height='360' width='480' yt:name='hqdefault'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IQaiUV3X_VU/1.jpg' height='90' width='120' time='00:00:15.500' yt:name='start'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IQaiUV3X_VU/2.jpg' height='90' width='120' time='00:00:31' yt:name='middle'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IQaiUV3X_VU/3.jpg' height='90' width='120' time='00:00:46.500' yt:name='end'/><media:title type='plain'>Guile's Theme Goes With Everything - Costa Concordia Cruise Ship</media:title><yt:aspectRatio>widescreen</yt:aspectRatio><yt:duration seconds='62'/><yt:uploaded>2012-01-19T05:12:56.000Z</yt:uploaded><yt:uploaderId>UCPWhQwsjZbIe6cn6D-WxkQA</yt:uploaderId><yt:videoid>IQaiUV3X_VU</yt:videoid></media:group><gd:rating average='4.6923075' max='5' min='1' numRaters='52' rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#overall'/><yt:statistics favoriteCount='0' viewCount='6836'/><yt:rating numDislikes='4' numLikes='48'/></entry>
