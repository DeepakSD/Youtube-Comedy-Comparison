The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English philologist and University of Oxford professor J.R.R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's earlier, less complex children's fantasy novel The Hobbit (1937), but eventually developed into a much larger work. It was written in stages between 1937 and 1949, much of it during World War II.[1] It is the third best-selling novel ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.[2]

The title of the novel refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron, who had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth. From quiet beginnings in the Shire, a Hobbit land not unlike the English countryside, the story ranges across north-west Middle-earth, following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters, notably the hobbits Frodo Baggins, Samwise "Sam" Gamgee, Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck and Peregrin "Pippin" Took, but also the hobbits' chief allies and travelling companions: Aragorn, a Human Ranger; Boromir, a man from Gondor; Gimli, a Dwarf warrior; Legolas, an Elven prince; and Gandalf, a Wizard.

The work was initially intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set, with the other being The Silmarillion, but this idea was dismissed by his publisher.[4][5] It was decided for economic reasons to publish The Lord of the Rings as three volumes over the course of a year from 21 July 1954 to October 1955, thus creating the now familiar Lord of the Rings trilogy.[4][6] The three volumes were entitled The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. Structurally, the novel is divided internally into six books, two per volume, with several appendices of background material included at the end of the third volume. The Lord of the Rings has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into many languages.

Tolkien's work has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins. Although a major work in itself, the story was only the last movement of a larger epic Tolkien had worked on since 1917, in a process he described as mythopoeia. Influences on this earlier work, and on the story of The Lord of the Rings, include philology, mythology, religion and the author's distaste for the effects of industrialization, as well as earlier fantasy works and Tolkien's experiences in World War I. The Lord of the Rings in its turn is considered to have had a great effect on modern fantasy; the impact of Tolkien's works is such that the use of the words "Tolkienian" and "Tolkienesque" has been recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary</media:description><media:keywords/><media:license type='text/html' href='http://www.youtube.com/t/terms'>youtube</media:license><media:player url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVNUhEhGIfQ&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yVNUhEhGIfQ/default.jpg' height='90' width='120' time='00:00:22.500' yt:name='default'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yVNUhEhGIfQ/mqdefault.jpg' height='180' width='320' yt:name='mqdefault'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yVNUhEhGIfQ/hqdefault.jpg' height='360' width='480' yt:name='hqdefault'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yVNUhEhGIfQ/sddefault.jpg' height='480' width='640' yt:name='sddefault'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yVNUhEhGIfQ/1.jpg' height='90' width='120' time='00:00:11.250' yt:name='start'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yVNUhEhGIfQ/2.jpg' height='90' width='120' time='00:00:22.500' yt:name='middle'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yVNUhEhGIfQ/3.jpg' height='90' width='120' time='00:00:33.750' yt:name='end'/><media:title type='plain'>Lord of the Rings Parody Samwise Gamgee is a Douchbag Funny</media:title><yt:aspectRatio>widescreen</yt:aspectRatio><yt:duration seconds='45'/><yt:uploaded>2011-10-15T01:16:33.000Z</yt:uploaded><yt:uploaderId>UCV0569g5DCeKGliVX3nCgwA</yt:uploaderId><yt:videoid>yVNUhEhGIfQ</yt:videoid></media:group><gd:rating average='4.2' max='5' min='1' numRaters='10' rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#overall'/><yt:statistics favoriteCount='0' viewCount='1270'/><yt:rating numDislikes='2' numLikes='8'/></entry>
