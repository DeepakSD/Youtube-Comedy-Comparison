When I was younger I loved a tv show of HBO called "The Kids in the Hall" this video is nothing like the comedy of those guys, but many people are saying this skit reminds them of that comedy troop. Here is some information Via Wikipedia and more about 'THE KIDS IN THE HALL" no cpyright infringement intended. 
The Kids in the Hall is a Canadian sketch comedy group formed in 1984, consisting of comedians Dave Foley, Kevin McDonald, Bruce McCulloch, Mark McKinney, and Scott Thompson. Their eponymous television show ran from 1988 to 1994 on CBC in Canada, and 1989 to 1995 on CBS and HBO in the United States. The theme song for the show was the instrumental "Having an Average Weekend" by the Canadian band Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet. The troupe made one movie, Brain Candy, which was released in 1996.
The name of the group came from Sid Caesar, who, if a joke didn't go over, or played worse than expected, would attribute it to "the kids in the hall," referring to a group of young writers hanging around the studio

Before the troupe formed, Bruce McCulloch and Mark McKinney were working together doing Theatresports in Calgary, performing in a group named "The Audience." Norm Hiscock, Gary Campbell, and Frank Van Keeken were co-members and later became writers on the show. At the same time, Dave Foley and Kevin McDonald were performing around Toronto (along with Luciano Casimiri) as The Kids in the Hall (KITH). In 1984, the two pairs met in Toronto, and began performing regularly as KITH, with a rotating band of members, including Paul Bellini for a short time. When Scott Thompson was invited to join in January 1985, the group had its final form. The same year, McCulloch and Foley appeared in the Anne of Green Gables series, as Diana Barry's husband and a former classmate of Anne's from the fictional Queen's College, respectively.
Not long afterwards, the Kids broke up for a short time when scouts for Saturday Night Live invited McKinney and McCulloch to New York to become writers for that show, Foley made a poorly received movie debut with High Stakes[3] and Thompson and McDonald worked with the Second City touring group. They were reunited in 1986. After SNL's Lorne Michaels saw them perform as a troupe, plans began for a TV show. In 1987 Michaels sent them to New York to what was essentially a "Comedy Boot Camp", and in 1988 their pilot special aired on CBC Television and in the United States on HBO before debuting as a series in 1989.
Headcrusher:
Mr. Tyzik (McKinney) is a lonely man who despises virtually everyone, especially those he considers businessmen and trendy people. He calls them "flatheads" because in his mind, their heads deserve to be crushed. He is more than willing to help by pretending to crush their heads from a distance with his fingers, using forced perspective, while enthusiastically declaring "I'm crushing your head! I'm crushing your head!" in a high-pitched nasal voice with a slight eastern European accent, followed by making a crushing noise. In his own words: "Not everyone deserves to have their head crushed, just 99.99999% of them." It is suggested that the headcrushing is not necessarily all in his head, in one sketch, where he is able to quickly determine that the heads of two people passing by have already been crushed by a "facepincher", with whom he proceeds to have a duel.</media:description><media:keywords/><media:license type='text/html' href='http://www.youtube.com/t/terms'>youtube</media:license><media:player url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3DVnRmC4Y8&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P3DVnRmC4Y8/default.jpg' height='90' width='120' time='00:00:35.500' yt:name='default'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P3DVnRmC4Y8/mqdefault.jpg' height='180' width='320' yt:name='mqdefault'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P3DVnRmC4Y8/hqdefault.jpg' height='360' width='480' yt:name='hqdefault'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P3DVnRmC4Y8/sddefault.jpg' height='480' width='640' yt:name='sddefault'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P3DVnRmC4Y8/1.jpg' height='90' width='120' time='00:00:17.750' yt:name='start'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P3DVnRmC4Y8/2.jpg' height='90' width='120' time='00:00:35.500' yt:name='middle'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P3DVnRmC4Y8/3.jpg' height='90' width='120' time='00:00:53.250' yt:name='end'/><media:title type='plain'>BLACK MAGIC FINGERS "HEAD CRUSHER"</media:title><yt:aspectRatio>widescreen</yt:aspectRatio><yt:duration seconds='71'/><yt:uploaded>2011-12-05T16:18:49.000Z</yt:uploaded><yt:uploaderId>UCcAHY7mJ-4FfvpZ0M4eiWOQ</yt:uploaderId><yt:videoid>P3DVnRmC4Y8</yt:videoid></media:group><gd:rating average='4.757576' max='5' min='1' numRaters='33' rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#overall'/><yt:statistics favoriteCount='0' viewCount='1940'/><yt:rating numDislikes='2' numLikes='31'/></entry>
