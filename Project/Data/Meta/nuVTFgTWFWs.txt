OC:Stephen, Camille, Ernie, random dude.

Beck's birthday party was well underway and every body was having a blast. The music was really loud and every one was on the dance floor.
"Kitty Cat, this party is amazing! Thank you. I don't know what I would do without you!" Beck shouted over the music pulling Cat into a hug.
"Aww, you're welcome!" Cat said hugging him back. Tori walked up and smiled at their embrace.
"Hey Beck! You enjoying the party?" Tori asked.
"Yeah. One question, where's the piñata?" Beck asked looking around. Cat looked at Tori with an I told you so look.
"Uh sorry we didn't get one." Tori replied glaring at Cat jokingly.
"Thats alright. Future reference, a party is not a party without a piñata!" Beck told her before walking into the crowd to dance again. Cat turned around and wrapped her arms around Tori's neck and pulled her in for a kiss. They started dancing and having a good time.
"Tori I'm going to get a drink! Want anything?" Cat asked.
"No I'm good. Be careful there are people here I don't even know." Tori replied making Cat nod and walk away.
"Hey Vega!" Andre said walking up to Tori.
"Hi Andre! I haven't seen you all day." Tori answered.
"Yeah well, me and Camille got into a fight because she's always hanging with Jade, and it kinda creeps me out!" Andre told her. Tori wanted so badly to tell him about why Camille was really here, but she couldn't hurt him.
"I don't know whats up with her. Jade hasn't really bothered us lately." Tori replied.
"Dude look, there's like 4 guys around Cat at the drink table" Andre said pointing over her shoulder to the drink table. Tori spun around and looked at what he was talking about.
When Tori saw that there were really  four guys surrounding Cat she wasn't happy. She stormed over there and grabbed ahold of Cats hand pulling her to the side.
"Who are they?" Tori shouted, her voice laced with jealousy.
"People. Why?" Cat asked upset that she pulled her away like that.
"Who are they?!" Tori yelled louder. She was really angry that Cat thought it was okay if she flirted with for guys while she couldn't even talk to Camille.
"Wow Tori, I can't believe you would think that I would cheat on you! And in you're own house, at a birthday party! Even if I was the type of person to cheat, I wouldn't be that disrespectful and cheat with you in the house! But that doesn't matter because I wouldn't cheat on you! Ever!" Cat yelled back.
"Then why are you talking to those guys?!" Tori asked loudly. Cat stormed over to the guys and pointed to each one naming them.
"This is my cousin Jesse, my cousin Aaron, my cousin Neil, and Neil's boyfriend Carter!" Cat yelled angrily. Now Tori felt stupid. "Guys, this is my over protective, jealous wife Tori." Cat said introducing them.
"Nice to meet all of you! I'm sorry that I was angry before, it was stupid." Tori apologized.
"It's okay, really!" Jesse replied chuckling.
"Kitty Cat, Can I talk to you in my room please?" Tori asked giving her a pleading look. Cat nodded and grabbed Tori's hand, walking up stairs with her.</media:description><media:keywords/><media:license type='text/html' href='http://www.youtube.com/t/terms'>youtube</media:license><media:player url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuVTFgTWFWs&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nuVTFgTWFWs/default.jpg' height='90' width='120' time='00:00:18' yt:name='default'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nuVTFgTWFWs/mqdefault.jpg' height='180' width='320' yt:name='mqdefault'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nuVTFgTWFWs/hqdefault.jpg' height='360' width='480' yt:name='hqdefault'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nuVTFgTWFWs/1.jpg' height='90' width='120' time='00:00:09' yt:name='start'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nuVTFgTWFWs/2.jpg' height='90' width='120' time='00:00:18' yt:name='middle'/><media:thumbnail url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nuVTFgTWFWs/3.jpg' height='90' width='120' time='00:00:27' yt:name='end'/><media:title type='plain'>When I make you shine!
