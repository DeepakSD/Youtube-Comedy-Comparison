Thankyou everyone, I never thought I'd have a video gain so much popularity. I'm glad it is in such a lovely fandom!  You guys are PAINFULLY SEXY.... and as far as the marriage proposals on tumblr... lets do it!! â™¥ 

So this is just a bit of fun with interviews.  Its crazy how much you miss vidding when you really can't. So I whipped this up because  I just started fangirling their relationship and they remind me of an eharmony commercial like woah lol

Wow, I've crossed 1000 subs. I am so grateful and humbled that so many people bothered to sub my madness!!

Finally ALOT of my friends have been deleted. If you like me enough to read this you will love them. So please help 
them re-build.

MissyourMaturity (she wasn't deleted but she is 2 away from 500!! Make it happen guys)

I dedicate this to Michelle (OasisWonder19) and Bonnie 
(MissYourMaturity)... the two biggest Andy/Jesse fans I know.

Also to catou121 for helping me to see how beautiful their 
bromance truly is with her GORGEOUS vid.
