Teen Simba wants to be like Randy Savage (OOOOOH YEAAH)

So yeah, this is pretty much the manliest dub of anything in the entire world. The original idea was for me to sing this song in full voice, but after my friend Andre (VACTORDREAMER OOOOOOOOOOH YEAAAAHH) comically mentioned that it would be hilarious if Zazu was played by Randy Savage, I actually ended up deciding to take the idea seriously! He was also so kind to mix everything in, including the outstanding visuals you see here. You may be asking why it's so short. The answer is simple! The average man can't handle this amount of awesome after 30 seconds before passing out, which is shown visually through the blackout at the end OOOOOOOOOOOOOH YEAH

Sheldon's voice sounds like a chipmunk.. very funny!!!!


Scene: Kripke is in a storage cupboard of some kind. He has tubes rigged up through the roof attached to helium tanks which he is turning on. The radio is playing.

Radio: This is Ira Flatow and you're listening to NPR's Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Kripke: Oh, this is going to be a wiot.

Scene switches to Sheldon's office, where the end of the tubing can be seen coming through the wall. Hissing can be heard.

Radio: Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.

Sheldon: My pleasure, Ira.

Ira: Now, let's talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?

Sheldon: Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, (the pitch of his voice begins to rise) as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, (pitch rises further) a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.

Ira: Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.

Sheldon (even higher pitch): No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.

Scene cuts to university cafeteria where Kripke is holding up the radio for all to listen.

Sheldon: A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I'm going to kill you!

Sheldon's voice sounds like a chipmunk.. very funny!!!!


Scene: Kripke is in a storage cupboard of some kind. He has tubes rigged up through the roof attached to helium tanks which he is turning on. The radio is playing.

Radio: This is Ira Flatow and you're listening to NPR's Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Kripke: Oh, this is going to be a wiot.

Scene switches to Sheldon's office, where the end of the tubing can be seen coming through the wall. Hissing can be heard.

Radio: Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.

Sheldon: My pleasure, Ira.

Ira: Now, let's talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?

Sheldon: Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, (the pitch of his voice begins to rise) as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, (pitch rises further) a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.

Ira: Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.

Sheldon (even higher pitch): No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.

Scene cuts to university cafeteria where Kripke is holding up the radio for all to listen.

Sheldon: A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I'm going to kill you!

After opening a whole bunch of toys, my son 3 year old came across a present with books....keep in mind that this was kinda like his first "real" Christmas....and again he's was only three years old!....let me repeat. ONLY THREE YEARS OLD... And that he could just about understand and get the concept of the whole gift getting thing. I guess much to the blame of me, the media, and every commercial out there on TV he was more under the perception that you only get "toys" for christmas. To him Books are the fun time we spend reading (no less than three) every night before he goes to bed. Let me make something clear again. HE REALLY DOES LOVE BOOKS! But I'm guessing he was "overwhelmed" after opening way too many gifts (my fault I went overboard that year) and I think he felt "tricked upon" when he opened the books.....plus the fact that we were laughing at his reaction kinda egged him on to say the Poo statement..... He really is one of the sweetest kids I know and to see this reaction (if you know him yourself) IS cute.
I have deleted a lot of very undeserved negative comments that have been posted....I understand now that without a good understanding of the back history one could make a poor assumption of him....but now i hope you know that he was ONLY THREE YEARS OLD PEOPLE and that he only thought your supposed to get toys for christmas....partly because of how commercialized this holiday has become.....we have since taught him differently..............but just for kicks were gonna wrap books again for him and see what happens....

Sheldon's voice sounds like a chipmunk.. very funny!!!!


Scene: Kripke is in a storage cupboard of some kind. He has tubes rigged up through the roof attached to helium tanks which he is turning on. The radio is playing.

Radio: This is Ira Flatow and you're listening to NPR's Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Kripke: Oh, this is going to be a wiot.

Scene switches to Sheldon's office, where the end of the tubing can be seen coming through the wall. Hissing can be heard.

Radio: Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.

Sheldon: My pleasure, Ira.

Ira: Now, let's talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?

Sheldon: Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, (the pitch of his voice begins to rise) as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, (pitch rises further) a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.

Ira: Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.

Sheldon (even higher pitch): No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.

Scene cuts to university cafeteria where Kripke is holding up the radio for all to listen.

Sheldon: A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I'm going to kill you!

On a lazy day I decided to try blowing bubbles for my daughter, Molly.  At first, she didn't think they were "all that," but then Bennie, the dog, showed Molly how much fun bubbles can be.  Molly thought Bennie's bubble popping was the funniest thing she has seen in her 9-1/2 months!

A little background info on Bennie:
We adopted Bennie from a shelter in Central Illinois in 2008.  They told us that he is a German Shepherd and Beagle mix.  We would not be surprised to find out that he has other breeds mixed in as well!

Sheldon's voice sounds like a chipmunk.. very funny!!!!


Scene: Kripke is in a storage cupboard of some kind. He has tubes rigged up through the roof attached to helium tanks which he is turning on. The radio is playing.

Radio: This is Ira Flatow and you're listening to NPR's Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Kripke: Oh, this is going to be a wiot.

Scene switches to Sheldon's office, where the end of the tubing can be seen coming through the wall. Hissing can be heard.

Radio: Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.

Sheldon: My pleasure, Ira.

Ira: Now, let's talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?

Sheldon: Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, (the pitch of his voice begins to rise) as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, (pitch rises further) a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.

Ira: Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.

Sheldon (even higher pitch): No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.

Scene cuts to university cafeteria where Kripke is holding up the radio for all to listen.

Sheldon: A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I'm going to kill you!

This person was selling a tool that you put on the top of your head and screw tight and it gives you instant lift and gets rid of bags under your eyes. She buys the product and uses it. She notice that there are still bags under eyed and continues to tighten it over and over again. She goes to the doctor to see what's wrong and explains to him everything thing about the tool. He then says to her, ma'am those aren't bags under your eyes. She says what are they then? The doctor replies, those are your breasts. The lady says, oh then this thing on my chin isn't a beard?

thanks fro the support, I really appreciate everything...
