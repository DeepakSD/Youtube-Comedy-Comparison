(21st of feb) EDIT: This WILL be the final edit, before the full video is released. I just wanted to take this time to say how awesome you guys are and how understanding you are with my constant delaying of the video release. I also notice alot of you have subscribed which is fairly cool (although I wont be offended if you un-sub once you see the full video, not that it's bad, it's just I tend to release random stuff on this channel, blogs and random guff that takes my fancy) although if you really do want to keep up to date with how things are going you can follow me on twitter at https://twitter.com/#!/Mangerive . I don't use it much although, I can promise I WILL reply to any comment or question made on there. Other than that you can except the new video imminently!

(19th of Feb) EDIT: I know I promised it by 3, although I seem to have over estimated my own skills. I've been getting problems with tracking as well as just making it awesome in the meantime! You've been quite patient so far, although I would rather spend more time on it and make it as good as it can be, rather than rush it and put out a video that isn't as awesome I'm hoping to make. Rest assured, getting this video finished has become my number 1 priority! (although A mans gotta have some down time, I actually fell asleep on my keyboard earlier)

(18th of Feb)EDIT:All of you guys are awesome! Getting some great feedback and I'm really motivated to finish off the video, as of now it's about 3/4's done (not including rendering) and it should be on time for latest 3pm 19th of Feb GMT!

(16th of Feb)EDIT: I'm Currently in the process of finishing the video, it should be out in the next two-three days, due to render times (and actually making it look good).
Thanks to everyone who liked this video and wanted me to finish it. KillaKarisma has actually seen this video and he said he loved it, so I'm hoping to impress him with the final version!

F.A.Q;

"What program did you use to make the effects?" - I used after effects CS5 for all of it. Everything you see here was done from scratch by me.
