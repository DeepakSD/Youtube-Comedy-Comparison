OC: Stephen, Camille.

The Vega's walked into the restaurant that they were going to me Tori's grandpa.
"Family!" Ernie Vega called out to his family.
"Grandpa!" Trina yelled going up to him and embracing him.
"Hello Trina! How is my first granddaughter?" Ernie asked.
"Good. How are you? Did you bring me a present?" Trina asked excitedly.
"Yes, here!" Ernie said as he handed Trina a little black box with gorgeous diamond earrings.
"Thanks grandpa!" Trina said sitting down and putting her earrings in.
"Hi grandpa!" Tori said letting go of Cats hand to embrace him. 
"Hows my little angel?" Ernie asked.
"Great!" Tori replied.
"Hows married life?" Ernie asked.
"Really amazing! I love being married to the woman of my dreams. It's kinda surreal" Tori answered honestly.
"Well thats fantastic! And Caterina! You look beautiful!" Ernie rejoiced.
"Thank you Mr. Vega!" Cat said being pulled into a hug.
"Oh you can call me grandpa!" Ernie told her.
"Okay grandpa!" Cat added happy that she was liked by Ernie.
They sat down and started skimming the menu. 
"So Caterina, what's your nationality?" Ernie asked interested.
"Well I'm Sicilian, and Abruzzese Italian. But my parents think that my great great grandmother was Portuguese! I wonder if they got the word Portuguese from gooses?! If they did why would they made an ethnicity out of them?" Cat asked randomly. She looked around the table and saw that everyone was staring at her so she giggled.
"Well that's good! What are your plans for the future?" Ernie questioned.
"Dad." Mr. Vega warned.
"What I'm just making conversation!" Ernie defended.
"No Mr. Vega it's okay! Our plans are to get into Juliard together, then once we graduate I would love to be on broadway again!" Cat answered truthfully.
"Juliard? What are your talents?" Ernie asked.
"Singing, dancing, and acting. Mostly singing. For both of us." Cat answered. Tori grabbed her hand underneath the table.
"Oh really. Let's hear some of your lovely singing!" Ernie said happily.
"Grandpa! Not here!" Tori exclaimed loudly.
"Oh come on the restaurant is very loud! Just sing quietly!" Ernie told her. Cat thought about what she should sing and started.
"I'm beautiful in my way, 'cause god makes no mistakes. I'm on the right track baby I was born this way. 
 Don't hide yourself in regret, just love your self and you're set. I'm on the right track baby I was born this way." She sang slowly. When she finished she noticed that the restaurant had went quiet, only to break out into applause when she was done.
"That was wonderful! You have a very bright future in singing!" Ernie exploded.
"Why thank you. I really enjoy singing and acting, they're my two passions." Cat explained.
Dinner went on without any hitches. Ernie and Cat talked a lot and got to know each other pretty well. Tori was ecstatic that Cat was making such a great impression on her family.
When they said goodbye to Ernie and went back home, everyone went their separate ways to do their own things. 
 Cat was helping Tori's dad plan his anniversary, and Tori wanted her to go to sleep with her.
"Cat, please come here!" Tori called from the couch.
"I'm coming in a minute." Cat said over her shoulder.
"But I'm tired!" Tori whined like a child.
"Then go to sleep!" Cat said.
"No, I can't sleep without you! Please come here!" Tori whined again.
"In a minute and that's that, Tori." Cat said in a mock stern voice, and sent a small wink at her.
Once Cat was done helping Mr.Vega, she made her way to the couch and laid on top of her sleeping wife. 
"Toooorrrriiii." Cat whispered on Tori's ear.
"Huh? Oh hey Babe. Let's go to my room." Tori said voice heavy with sleep. They stood up and Tori grabbed Cats hand and pulled her up the stairs.
"So where are my parents going for their anniversary?" Tori asked making her way to her room.
"They are going to the Bahamas!" Cat said excitedly.
"Really? Cool! How long?" Tori asked pushing her door open.
"1 Week! They said that we get the house to ourselves because Trina is going out of town with her new boyfriend for the week!" Cat told her.
"That's awesome! It'll be like a second honeymoon, but at home!" Tori exclaimed pulling her shirt off to put her pajama shirt on.
"Yeah! And we can throw Beck a birthday party!" Cat said excitedly while pulling her night gown on.
"Oh yeah. I forgot that it's Beck's birthday that week." Tori added in.
"Yup! I always throw him a birthday party, except for last year because of the whole Jade hating you thing, but every year before that I've thrown him a big party!" Cat told her making gestures with her hand the whole time.
"Well okay! But can we go to sleep? I have a history test tomorrow and I don't want to be tired for it." Tori said getting into bed. Cat climbed in beside her and snuggled close to her side.
"Good night Tori, I Love You!" Cat said.
"I love you too." Tori replied before falling asleep.
